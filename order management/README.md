This is a Quote management project
In this project user will be able to -
1. Enter Quote's author name and the Quote text in a form.
2. On submission of the form that Quote body and author name will be diaplyed under the Quote Lists section.
3. Selecting each list element under the Quote Lists section will allow user to change the Quote text data.

For this project, we have created two components -
1. QuoteFormComp - consisting of a form that takes user input for the Quote name and text.
2. QuoteFormComp - Will display the form values from QuoteFormComp components as a list.
