# ReactExercises
This repository has some basic React challenges that will help you clarify basic React concepts.


1. Create a **React form** with limited validations.
[check it here](https://github.com/Ankhi12/ReactExercises/blob/main/simpleForm.html)

2. How does two React function components talk to each other.

        Points to note -
        
          a. You can pass a state as a prop to the dependent function component.
          b. You can call the dependent function component from the main function component inside the JSX section of the later.
          c. You can then modify the JSX of the dependent function component as per your requirement.
